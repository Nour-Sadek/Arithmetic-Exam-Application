# Arithmetic Exam Application

### Learning Outcomes
Learn how to handle input and output, employ the random number generator, 
and write the output to a file.

### About
The application will generate mathematical expressions for a user to solve. 
Two levels of difficulty are implemented, and the application will save the results 
in a file.
